- 👋 Hi, I’m @RabbitPantz
- 👀 I’m interested in Code, Music, Star Wars and seeing how many pretzels I can fit in my mouth while maintaining a fluid conversation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some more Advanced .NET, about to start learning Ruby on Rails, hopefully after .NET ML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can get my mits on.
- 📫 How to reach me - Use the force, a signal fire, postage pigeons
